1. Threads return OK when download fails.  This is because the threads simply start the download, not ensure the files appear.
2. Add forms information allowing the user to search evolutions via a separate GUI window.
3. Some pokemon like urshifu have different forms that are not recognized by GOIV.app.  Not sure of a fix.
4. Add a search_entry_status_label and replace the showwarning box with an ecode.
5. Touch up some entry and label padding.
6. Clean up documentation using a documentation style of choice.
7. Combine the search/lookup buttons into one (Not sure if I want to do this...)
    Good idea if the function for both checks the search entry contents for a different
    query before performing a new query.  If it's the same, just do the iv_lookup.
8. Instead of deselecting the checkboxes on unfound query, maybe change how movesets/leagues display when not found.
	This is so you don't have to re-check the boxes after a bad query
9. Generalize UIInfo class so that it can be used for the separate evolution GUI
